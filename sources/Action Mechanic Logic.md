# Action Mechanics

The game employs the DIME (Diplomacy, Intelligence, Military, Economics) framework as the foundation for all participant actions. This model, drawn from national security doctrine and validated through exercises like CNAS’s “Chips Are Down” and RAND’s “Coupled Competition,” provides a comprehensive structure for simulating strategic competition across all instruments of national power.[^1]

## DIME Categories

| DIME Category | Scope \& Application |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Diplomacy** | Bilateral and multilateral negotiations, trade agreements, alliance formation, demarches, diplomatic recognition, partnership upgrades, coalition building for coordinated economic actions. |
| **Intelligence** | Supply chain vulnerability assessment, industrial espionage detection, early warning indicators, technology theft identification, sanctions evasion monitoring, critical infrastructure mapping. |
| **Military** | Security guarantees, freedom of navigation operations, military exercises with partners, defense industrial base coordination, arms sales, military aid packages, maritime security for trade routes. |
| **Economics** | Trade policy, sanctions, investment controls, technology transfer restrictions, development finance, supply chain diversification, industrial policy, tariffs, market access mechanisms. |

Within this context, the options that participants are provided for actions are broken down within a PUNISH/REWARD spectrum detailed as follows.[^1]

## Economic Mechanisms and Measures

| Mechanism | Measures |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sanctions / Financial Restrictions** | - Payment-system exclusion  <br> - Asset freezes and blocking sanctions (including major banks)  <br> - Secondary sanctions  <br> - Sovereign debt and credit restrictions  <br> - Correspondent banking limits |
| **Export Controls** | - Export licensing and denials based on control lists  <br> - Entity List and related designations  <br> - Supply-chain exclusion for targeted firms  <br> - High-tech export bans (e.g., semiconductors, AI chips, lithography tools)  <br> - Talent and visa restrictions in sensitive fields |
| **Investment / Capital Controls** | - Inbound investment screening and FDI prohibitions in critical sectors  <br> - Outbound investment restrictions for strategic industries  <br> - Limits on joint ventures and greenfield projects in high‑risk sectors |
| **Trade Policy** | - Comprehensive or sectoral embargoes  <br> - Targeted import and export bans  <br> - Tariff increases or reductions  <br> - Special trade status and free trade agreements |
| **Financial / Digital Asset Policy** | - Targeted transaction reporting  <br> - Restrictions on crypto exchanges and sanctions-linked wallets  <br> - Licensing rules for digital-asset providers  <br> - Enhanced capital and compliance requirements for high‑risk exposure |
| **General Economic Statecraft / Cross-Cutting Tools** | - Regulatory harmonization  <br> - Mutual recognition agreements  <br> - Transparency and due-diligence standards; technical assistance for regulatory capacity  <br> - Information-sharing arrangements among regulators  <br> - Whole-of-government coordination mechanisms |
| **Industrial Policy** | - Production subsidies and tax credits for strategic sectors  <br> - Grants and R\&D consortia  <br> - Public–private partnerships and state‑backed finance  <br> - Cluster and location‑based incentives |
| **Infrastructure \& Workforce Development / Supply-Chain Resilience** | - Grants and concessional loans for infrastructure  <br> - Multilateral development bank financing  <br> - Support for nearshoring and friendshoring  <br> - Long‑term offtake agreements  <br> - Workforce development and reskilling  <br> - Supply‑chain mapping and diversification support |
